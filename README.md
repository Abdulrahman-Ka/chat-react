## üöÄ Setup and Run Locally

Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v16 or higher).
- Docker (required to run Appwrite locally).

### Step 1: Clone and Install Dependencies

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Abdulrahman-Ka/chat-react.git](https://github.com/Abdulrahman-Ka/chat-react.git)
cd chat-react
Install React dependencies
npm install
```

### step 2: Appwrite Configuration

1. **Start Appwrite:** Run your Appwrite instance locally using Docker.

2. **Create Project:** Create a new project in the Appwrite Console 3. and retrieve your Project ID.

3. **Set Environment Variables:**

- Create a file named .env.local in the root directory of your project.

```js
//appwrite.Config.js
...
export const API_ENDPOINT = import.meta.env.VITE_API_ENDPOINT;
export const PROJECT_ID = import.meta.env.VITE_PROJECT_ID;
export const DATABASE_ID = import.meta.env.VITE_DATABASE_ID;
export const COLLECTION_ID_MESSAGES = import.meta.env
  .VITE_COLLECTION_ID_MESSAGES;

const client = new Client().setEndpoint(API_ENDPOINT).setProject(PROJECT_ID);

...

```

- Add your environment variables (replace the placeholders with your actual values):

```
# These names must match what your React app expects in appwriteConfig
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID"
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT="http://localhost/v1"
```

4.  **Configure CORS**: Add http://localhost:5173 (or your specific port) as a trusted Web Platform in your Appwrite Console settings to prevent CORS errors during local development.

### step 3: Run the Application

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will run in development mode, typically accessible at http://localhost:5173 in your browser.
